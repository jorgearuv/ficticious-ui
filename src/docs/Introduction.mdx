    Each component is designed to adhere to the following standards:

    * Customizable: Fluent-styled components by default, but easy to integrate your own brand and theme
    * Performance: Optimized for render performance
    * Bundle size: Refactored and slimmed down components that allow you to include the packages and dependencies you need
    * Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliant and tested by trusted testers
    * Design to Code: Stay up to date with changes via Design Tokens (WIP)
